                <b>Hacking Sound, Hacking History: Patricia Cadavid and the Electronic_Khipu_</b>
                <p>To better understand researcher and artist Patricia Cadavid Hinojosa’s instrument the <a href = "https://www.patriciacadavid.net/2019/09/electronickhipu-nime-experimental-sound.html">Electronic_Khipu_</a>, we must define the project as an instance of hacking. Cadavid deconstructs colonial understandings of the Andean device known as the khipu, pulling apart the academic view of khipus as artifacts to be deciphered, the strict delineation between administrative and ritualistic uses of the khipu, and the separation of the oral tradition from the object. Through deliberate design choices and musical expression in performance, Cadavid emphasizes the inextricability of coding, art, and ritual by creating a tactile device that re-tells history and challenges the false oppositional binary between Indigeneity and technology. Understanding this project of digital lutherie as an act of creation through hacking -- specifically as the deconstruction and reconfigurement of artistic and historical components, utilizing scholars Astrida Neimani's and Vít Bohal's definitions -- allows us to appreciate its power.</p>

                <br>
                <b>The Mythologization and Marketing of the Lesbian History in the Lesbian Bar Renaissance</b>
                <p>In October of 2020 two filmmakers, sponsored by the liqueur company Jagermeister, joined forces to launch a mid-pandemic fundraiser and awareness campaign about the disappearance of lesbian bars. “The Lesbian Bar Project,” as the campaign was dubbed, was by many measures successful: it brought national attention to the issue, raised over $267k for struggling bars over two years, and, significantly, helped to inspire a new wave of lesbian bars – fourteen bars claiming some affiliation with the term “lesbian” opened across the U.S from 2021 to 2024. 
                <br><br>Extensively covered by local media sources and social media chatter, these new bars were spoken of in almost religious language: emerging from death and darkness, they represented a rebirth, a “renaissance.” This myth making, unlike specific historical or memory work, allowed these bar owners to entrepreneurially position their businesses as a continuation of an important legacy – so much so that patronage of these bars was framed as akin to political participation. It also allowed bar owners to differentiate their businesses from those of the past without having to grapple meaningfully with histories of exclusion; though some bars’ efforts to address historical harm should not be discounted, the majority focused solely on rhetorical and linguistic strategies for gender inclusion  – complex updated definitions of “lesbian bar” were ubiquitous – and to a lesser extent, racial inclusion. Class inclusion, however, was not prioritized, and many of the attempts to distance from the dive bar of the past involved the “elevation” of bar design, replicating the processes of gentrification that put so many lesbian bars out of business. 
                <br><br>Drawing from interviews, articles, and online discussions, I analyze the discourse surrounding the new lesbian bars of the post-Covid Biden era, arguing that these bars were primarily marketed through the mythologization of dead lesbian bars. In addition to evading historical and memory work, the sources that I analyze prioritize the individual fulfillment of patrons (foregrounding neoliberal conceptions of safety, inclusion, and authenticity) instead of committing to a larger goal of collective liberation, thereby rewriting the actual pasts of lesbian bars while shaping what we expect of the present.

            <p>For my final project in the class Platform Activism, I chose to study Smith College’s campus webcams, a set of camera feeds that are continually broadcasted on YouTube and mostly monitor the pond and active construction. This project contained three parts: first, an investigation into rhetorics of security on college campuses; second, five interviews with Smith employees associated with the webcams (three of whom attended the installation); and third, this art installation. Smith College webcams have taken on a life of their own, with uses far beyond their intended purposes: students and parents alums check in with them daily, Smith uses them for marketing the campus’ idyllic vistas, Alumni Relations sends construction timelapses to alums who have donated to specific projects, and Campus Safety has used them as investigative tools. In March of 2025, five of the livestreams were taken off of YouTube due to privacy concerns, but the actual cameras remained up and are now part of Campus Safety’s CCTV network.


            <br><br>These webcams do not originate in a desire to surveil students on the part of Smith College, but rather demonstrate the college’s participation in a larger culture of securitization that encourages constant video monitoring as a way to protect property, generate capital, and regulate bodies. Reproducing tactics of the state, Smith College uses the language of “security” in order to police its borders (for example, forcibly removing unhoused people from campus) and control its population (for example, monitoring and punishing protest activity). The Smith College webcams actualize the aesthetics of this security rhetoric, providing an immediate and localized medium through which understandings of security can be questioned. 


            <br><br>In order to respond to these webcams and the logics that they encoded, I aimed to create a participatory intervention that drew attention to both the strangeness and the beauty of the footage while subverting the watcher/watched power dynamic. I was inspired by American conceptual artist Jill Magid’s work Evidence Locker (2004), in which she developed a close relationship with the Liverpool police, asking them to film her in particular poses or guide her through the city. Another inspiration came from the collective CAMP’s work Al Jaar Qabla Al Daar (The Neighbour Before the House) (2009-2011), in which they affixed CCTV cameras to the houses of eight Palestinian families in and around Jerusalem and asked them to manipulate and narrate the footage, resulting in deeply personal accounts of violence and displacement. 


            <br><br>Throughout the semester, I spent time outside of Wesley House and asked passersby to look directly into the camera as they passed by the construction site. As I recorded the footage off of YouTube, I found that many also waved, stared at, or even jumped around in front of the camera. It was really meaningful to engage with fellow students on these questions – we often had long discussions about the webcams before they walked past the construction site – while providing a space of resistance and playfulness, rather than unpleasant surprise and feelings of powerlessness, two common reactions to the webcams. In presenting the footage, I aimed to create a feeling of both overwhelming surveillance (the grid format is similar to a CCTV control room) with the twist that the majority of passersby were noticing, interacting, or even blocking the camera. I cycled through the footage and repeated clips in different locations across the grid, providing visual motifs and an element of serendipity.


            <br><br>Additionally, I recorded cropped footage of the “Paradise Pond Spillway View” webcam (as well as the “Paradise Pond View” webcam) focusing on framing the oddities of monitoring moving water in this way: the periodic lag, the intense pixelation, the hourly dip that the camera makes in order to inspect the riverbed sediment. Framing and zooming in on the camera in this way proved surprisingly beautiful, especially when projected in a large format. I presented these clips as “portals” against a black background, appearing and reappearing in roughly fifteen-second increments in seemingly random locations. I wanted to isolate and decontextualize the pond camera, and to encourage viewers to spend time deeply considering the pixels that make up the spillway, such an iconic part of Smith’s visual identity – which brings up questions of how marketing and capital interests intersect with surveillance. I also spent a couple of afternoons tracking myself on the Paradise Pond Spillway View camera, walking in a red shirt across the rocky area near the dam and climbing up the side of the spillway. The recording of this footage provided a natural connection to the video of the construction site by tracking human movement. Additionally, it blurs the distinction of acceptability that we normally place between surveilling humans and surveilling the environment.


            <br><br>In the installation, I paired these two 7 and 8 minute videos together in a continual loop, projecting them onto adjacent walls at slightly different sizes but similar levels. I created a soundtrack based off of what my laptop recorded as I sat outside of Wesley – I had not noticed the audio recording until later, adding a personalized layer of surveillance –  incorporating the ambient noise, slight construction noises, and the conversations about the cameras that I had with participants. The conversations, which I distorted to make indecipherable for both privacy reasons and to create a slightly haunting sense of slight removal, give a voice to an otherwise voiceless participation process, as the webcams themselves do not record sound (Tony Caldanaro of the CATS Lab, the operator of the majority of the webcams, said that the soundtrack made him doubt for a minute whether the webcams actually broadcasted audio: this soundtrack-provoked ambiguity was interesting to exploit). I also added a chord with synthesized organ – a seventh between D# and C#, which provides a subtle melodic drone that holds no obvious emotional quality, as I did not want the soundtrack to sound overly sinister. The sonic component is unobstructive and mirrors the themes of the visuals in order to facilitate the overall goal of the exhibition: to subtly rework of the aesthetics of securitization at Smith College.

            In this project, I affixed two lapel microphones to a locker bank and hid 
            multiple bluetooth speakers that played both channels within the lockers. 
            The result was a metallic, resonant body that amplified whispered conversations and breath.

            Inspired by the many hidden sources of water that flow into the Mill River, 
            I hid microphones near an open pipe and amplified the sound throughout the river bank 
            using bluetooth speakers, creating the illusion of a plethora of hidden water sources. 
            The microphones also pick up breath, conversation, and singing near the open pipe, 
            creating an interactive projection of privacy along the river bank.

            <br>
            The Puara Framework, an open source library and toolbox, seeks
            to lower the high barriers of entry to New Interface for Music
            Expression (NIME) creation. The most recent update to Puara
            generalizes the expertise in gestural control of T-Stick performers
            and designers, utilizing a decades-old knowledge base for the
            creation, maintenance, and performance of other digital musical
            instruments. Two new gestures, roll and tilt, were ported into
            the puara-gestures library from the T-Stick, allowing a broader
            audience of artists and researchers to access these gestural mappings. This expansion of the Puara library continues the mission
            of creating tools by building on the legacy of historical NIMEs.
