<p>Spotify’s “On Repeat” playlist, part of an 
    ever-growing legion of personalized playlists 
    developed by the streaming platform, offers 
    a collection of “songs you love right now,” 
    sourced from your listening habits over the 
    past thirty days. Sometimes I glaze over the 
    songs, mildly surprised at what sounds have been 
    – at least according to the data –  defining my past 
    month. When I listen to the playlist, I worry 
    about the algorithm cannibalizing itself: by listening 
    to the songs, I push them more into “On Repeat,”
     an infinity echo in digital streaming.
