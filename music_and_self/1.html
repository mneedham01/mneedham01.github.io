<p>The HAIM song “Want You Back” came out in early May 2017, 
    while I was making the post-breakup move from New Haven, 
    Connecticut, back to Columbus, Ohio. My belongings were 
    still in a moving truck slowly making its way across the country, 
    so my new Columbus apartment was empty, but for a television and 
    a large trash can. The emptiness of the space and the high 
    ceilings allowed for a type of <a href = "2.html" target="iframe2">infinity echo</a>. I played the HAIM 
    song on my phone, and each line of the chorus repeated and bloomed anew, 
    <a href = "3.html" target="iframe2">furnishing the room with its weight.</a>
