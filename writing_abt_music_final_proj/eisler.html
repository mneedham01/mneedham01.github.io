        Eisler and Adorno on the introduction of music to cinema: 
        <div></div>
        “Sound, in the form of music, gave back to those 
        ‘dead’ photographic images some of the life they 
        lost in the process of mechanical reproduction.” 
        <div></div>
        “The magic function of music ... probably consisted in 
        appeasing the evil spirits unconsciously dreaded. 
        Music was introduced as a kind of antidote against the picture"
         – to “help the spectator absorb the shock”
