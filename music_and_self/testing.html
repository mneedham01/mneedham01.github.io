        <div class="text">The HAIM song “Want You Back” came out in early May 2017, while I was making the post-breakup move from New Haven, Connecticut, back to Columbus, Ohio. My belongings were still in a moving truck slowly making its way across the country, so my new Columbus apartment was empty, but for a television and a large trash can. The emptiness of the space and the high ceilings allowed for a type of infinity echo. I played the HAIM song on my phone, and each line of the chorus repeated and bloomed anew, furnishing the room with its weight.</div>

        <p> Spotify’s “On Repeat” playlist, part of an ever-growing legion of personalized playlists developed by the streaming platform, offers a collection of “songs you love right now,” sourced from your listening habits over the past thirty days. Sometimes I glaze over the songs, mildly surprised at what sounds have been – at least according to the data –  defining my past month. When I listen to the playlist, I worry about the algorithm cannibalizing itself: by listening to the songs, I push them more into “On Repeat,” an infinity echo in digital streaming. </p>
