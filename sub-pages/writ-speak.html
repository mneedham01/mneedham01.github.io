                <b>The Mythologization and Marketing of the Lesbian History in the Lesbian Bar Renaissance</b><br>
                Presentation and Paper at the <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.sinisterwisdom.org/lesbianlives2025">Lesbian Lives Conference</a>. Oct 24 - 26, 2025. NYC, US. 
                <p>In October of 2020 two filmmakers, sponsored by the liqueur company Jagermeister, 
                joined forces to launch a mid-pandemic fundraiser and awareness campaign about the disappearance of lesbian bars. 
                “The Lesbian Bar Project,” as the campaign was dubbed, was by many measures successful: it brought national attention 
                to the issue, raised over $267k for struggling bars over two years, and, significantly, helped to inspire a new wave of 
                lesbian bars – fourteen bars claiming some affiliation with the term “lesbian” opened across the U.S from 2021 to 2024. 

                <br><br>Extensively covered by local media sources and social media chatter, these new bars were spoken of in almost 
                religious language: emerging from death and darkness, they represented a rebirth, a “renaissance.” This myth making, 
                unlike specific historical or memory work, allowed these bar owners to entrepreneurially position their businesses as a 
                continuation of an important legacy – so much so that patronage of these bars was framed as akin to political participation.
                It also allowed bar owners to differentiate their businesses from those of the past without having to grapple meaningfully 
                with histories of exclusion; though some bars’ efforts to address historical harm should not be discounted, the majority 
                focused solely on rhetorical and linguistic strategies for gender inclusion  – complex updated definitions of “lesbian bar” 
                were ubiquitous – and to a lesser extent, racial inclusion. Class inclusion, however, was not prioritized, and many of the 
                attempts to distance from the dive bar of the past involved the “elevation” of bar design, replicating the processes of 
                gentrification that put so many lesbian bars out of business. 

                <br><br>Drawing from interviews, articles, and online discussions, I analyze the discourse surrounding the new lesbian 
                bars of the post-Covid Biden era, arguing that these bars were primarily marketed through the mythologization of dead lesbian bars.
                In addition to evading historical and memory work, the sources that I analyze prioritize the individual fulfillment of patrons 
                (foregrounding neoliberal conceptions of safety, inclusion, and authenticity) instead of committing to a larger goal of collective 
                liberation, thereby rewriting the actual pasts of lesbian bars while shaping what we expect of the present.

            Presentation and Paper at the <a target="_blank" href = "https://nime2025.org/">New Interfaces for Musical Expression Conference</a>. June 24 - 27, 2025. Canberra, Australia.
            <p>To better understand researcher and artist Patricia Cadavid Hinojosa’s instrument the <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.patriciacadavid.net/2019/09/electronickhipu-nime-experimental-sound.html">Electronic_Khipu_</a>, we must define the project as an instance of hacking. Cadavid deconstructs colonial understandings of the Andean device known as the khipu, pulling apart the academic view of khipus as artifacts to be deciphered, the strict delineation between administrative and ritualistic uses of the khipu, and the separation of the oral tradition from the object. Through deliberate design choices and musical expression in performance, Cadavid emphasizes the inextricability of coding, art, and ritual by creating a tactile device that re-tells history and challenges the false oppositional binary between Indigeneity and technology. Understanding this project of digital lutherie as an act of creation through hacking -- specifically as the deconstruction and reconfigurement of artistic and historical components, utilizing scholars Astrida Neimani's and Vít Bohal's definitions -- allows us to appreciate its power.</p>
