        I don’t need to remind you what Joan Didion said, 
        the whole “telling ourselves stories in order to live” bit. 
        She also said a good deal about self respect, too, but that part 
        isn’t as easily distilled into a repeatable sentence. Everyone deserves 
        to be the main character of their own life. 
        Everyone is the main character of their own life. 
        There’s no blame in desiring this, no crime in wanting to find 
        a compelling story in your relationships — be they positive ones or not.
