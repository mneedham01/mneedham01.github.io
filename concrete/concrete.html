<!-- Goals: 
    One picture of concrete every 3 seconds 
    Where the mouse is the picture zooms in 

    -> Onclick: Change picture 
    
    1. Figure out how to get the picture to be the whole screen  - Done 
    2. Figure out timer - Done
    3. Figure out how to zoom in on mouse

    -> Could you combine the next shot instead? I like the idea of layering 
    -> Fit the pieces together like a puzzle? 
    -> More intentionality 
    -> Poems? 
    -> Theme of trying to get you to look really look 
    -> Add red squares that carry over from page to page 
    -> Game? 
    -
    
    Questions. .. 
    - does it stop zooming in? Maybe never. You get to pixels. 
    - can you zoom back out? Yes... Idk
    - does speed of mouse affect it 
    - does it change
    - lag period of waiting -->
