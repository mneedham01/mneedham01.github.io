            <br>
            The Puara Framework, an open source library and toolbox, seeks
            to lower the high barriers of entry to New Interface for Music
            Expression (NIME) creation. The most recent update to Puara
            generalizes the expertise in gestural control of T-Stick performers
            and designers, utilizing a decades-old knowledge base for the
            creation, maintenance, and performance of other digital musical
            instruments. Two new gestures, roll and tilt, were ported into
            the puara-gestures library from the T-Stick, allowing a broader
            audience of artists and researchers to access these gestural mappings. This expansion of the Puara library continues the mission
            of creating tools by building on the legacy of historical NIMEs.

            EarSketch is an educational digital audio workstation that engages middle and high schoolers with musical programming. 
            I wrote educational material on audio effects, integrating examples into 
            the EarSketch website with descriptions based on the cultural uses and 
            physics of sound. I also refactored buggy audio features and implemented a new
            widget that allows users to preview coded beats, connecting the technical 
            and creative processes of music making.
