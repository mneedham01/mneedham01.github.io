                From your year of being 56 ...
                <br><br>
                Looking at capybaras, owls, and many birds in Argentina. Investing in the perfect pattern of day: breakfast on the 
                pond, activity, lounging, dinner, and reading. 
                <br><br>
                Getting a morning latte and eating Duck in a Can in Montreal.
                <br><br>
                Re-investing in our pounce potential in Annisquam; getting so good we cannot play with anyone else. THWAP THWAP THWAP. 
                <br><br>
                Christmas Eve with fondue AND raclette. Hosting up a storm. 
                <br><br>
                Swimming with stingrays (including disabled stingrays) in Mexico. Also turtles. 
                <br><br>
                Prank calling Poppy about the bear while eating chocolate lava cakes. 
                <br><br>
                Here's to 57 ... I can't wait to play more pounce in wonderful locations!
