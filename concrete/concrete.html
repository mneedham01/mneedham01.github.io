<!-- Goals: 
    One picture of concrete every 3 seconds 
    Where the mouse is the picture zooms in 
    
    1. Figure out how to get the picture to be the whole screen 
    2. Figure out timer
    3. Figure out how to zoom in on mouse
    
    Questions. .. 
    - does it stop zooming in? Maybe never. You get to pixels. 
    - can you zoom back out? Yes... Idk
    - does speed of mouse affect it 
    - does it change
    - lag period of waiting -->
